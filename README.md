###Cybersecurity Roadmap Github

So, you wanna learn how to hack? I wanna learn too!!! Let's learn together.

Now, I'm not an expert hacker. I haven't found bugs to make me look cool(yet). I don't even have a certificate(yet). However, it's not like I don't know anything. I just haven't got the opportunity to show off yet (or haven't created one!)

I ain't Mitnick yet, but I can be one. And so can you.

This repo is focused on a guided roadmap on entering cybersecurity. I will divide the sources into free and paid sources. 

Whatever I've learnt till now, I have learnt for free(apart from a few months of tryhackme that I won on a giveaway). And I know just how frustrating it is to not have a guide. So, allow me to clear (some) frustrations.

Here, I assume that you already know what a computer is :)

## Prerequisites

Apart from already knowing what a computer is, there are few more things you should have.

**The first one is `reading`** 

- Not every tutorial is video based. Not every knowledge is shared on YouTube. Reading is the most basic thing. If you can't sit down and read for like, atleast 30 minutes, you should build that skill first.
- Trust me when I say this, reading might be the most essential skills. It has happened to me multiple times, while solving some ctfs, I hesitated reading long paragraphs and tried to skim through it. I got stuck on a single problem for hours. And to my (unfortunate and frustrating) surprise, the main hint was right in front of me all the time.
- Remember, reading is not skimming. By reading, I mean thorough reading of each and every word. Don't underestimate any information. Read it, even if you don't feel like it.

**The second one : `Taking notes`**

- This is also very important. You ain't savant bruv. You ain't any special either. Just accept the fact that your brain, while being the most decorated organ in this planet, is very fragile and vulnerable to memory loss.
- TAKE NOTES. Don't be foolish enough by thinking that you'll remember it. You won't. You pretty damn sure won't. Even Einstein needed notes (probably).
- Here are some sites that I recommend ( I mean, I can recommend stuffs right? Even though I'm not a big deal? I ain't even a small deal tbh. Not yet atleast)
    - Notion
    - Obsidian
- You can use any other tool to take notes. Heck, go with Google Docs if you are crazy enough. Take notes on a physical diary if you want. But I recommend you to make online notes, accessible anywhere, and sharable to anyone.

**The third one: `restraint`**

- Now what do I mean by this? Show restraint on immediately reading writeups and walk-throughs. This is a rabbit hole that I fell into. Maybe that’s why I’m not a (big) deal yet?
- Writeups are great, but use it as a way to improve, not as a way to cheat. Try to solve it yourself first, try asking for hints to friends after that, and at the very end, open writeups.
- For example: You find that a website has XYZ version 1.2. What after that? Instead of searching for writeups, maybe search for `XYZ 1.2` . You might find some exploits and PoCs. Or maybe a way to circumvent through the defenses. Try to implement that yourself. If you can’t, don’t worry. ***The CTO of a big cyber firm also didn’t know what a network was once upon a time!***

**The fourth one: `responsible use of AI`**

- Alright, this is a pretty controversial point. I don’t know what the future holds, but as for the present date (5/23/2025), I stand by it.
- Want to code a keylogger? **DON’T MAKE AI DO IT!!!** Do it yourself. Learn which libraries to import, which methods to use.
- This is another rabbit hole that has held me from becoming a ***Master Hacker.*** I will share my experience to make you understand why to use AI responsibly?
- I was at a CTF competition. I just asked ChatGPT how to solve stuffs, how to write code, how to implement payloads. I managed to solve 2 challenges that day. Later on, while reading the writeup from the winner of the CTF, I just realized the difference between a real hacker and a script kiddie. I realized just how much knowledge the winner possessed, and just how much I lacked.
- Remember, if you depend on AI, your creativity ends where AI’s creativity ends. When AI stops giving reasonable answers, well, Game Over for you after that.
- ***Use AI to understand, not to cheat.***

## Networking

This is the very basics. Cybersecurity is dependent on this field.

- Bonus Tip: While this is not absolutely necessary, it is very much recommended to learn how to use Cisco Packet Tracer to implement Routers, VLANs, DHCPs, and DNS. This will make the concepts even more clear.
- Bonus Tip 2: This is **necessary.** Learn to use Wireshark too!!! Just the basics? Sure. But learn it too.

## Vim (Optional but recommended)

Vim!

## Programming and Stuffs(Very much recommended)

About coding, no need to learn everything. But do understand how things work!

Also, you can choose any video you wish from the Internet.

With this much knowledge, you can proudly call yourself a beginner in Cybersecurity. Yes, a beginner. The real deal starts from here.

## Learning the basic tools

You won’t hack everything with scratch. You have to learn how to use a few of the most used tools.

| **Topic** | **Tools** |
| --- | --- |
| Network Mapping | nmap |
| Website enumeration | ffuf, gobuster, dnsenum, amass etc. |
| Command Line Tools | nc, curl |
| Web App Hacking | Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLMap |
| Password Cracking | John The Ripper, hashcat, hydra |
| Privilege Escalation  | linpeas |
- I believe that you will learn these tools as you start solving labs and start learning more. So, apart from few tools like nmap, gobuster(or other), nc, curl, burp suite…others are not absolutely necessary to learn in the beginning.

## Web Application Security

All right, so wanna learn different vulnerabilities and expand your knowledge arsenal? There are enough sites to do this for free!

| **Link** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [https://portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/)/ | Theory and hands-on lab for all major vulnerabilities |
| https://tryhackme.com/ | Some are free, some are paid, figure it out yourself |
| https://www.hackthebox.com/ | The basics are free, others cost money
Active machines are also free in the lab, retired needs money |
